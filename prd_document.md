# Product Requirement Document (PRD)

## User Requirements

The essential fields for user registration process are:
1. Full Name: To address the user properly across the system.
2. Email: To communicate with the user, send notifications or reset password.
3. Password: To secure the user's account.
4. Phone Number (optional): To provide a secondary mode of communication or verification.
5. Date of Birth (optional): To ensure the user is of the minimum age to use the service.
6. Agreement to Terms and Conditions: To ensure legal compliance.
It's important to remember to keep the process as simple as possible to maintain user friendliness. The optional fields can be filled out after registration to complete the user profile.

## UI/UX Design

Here's an overview of the user-friendly registration interface design:

1. The registration interface will be a clear and clean single page layout, to avoid overwhelming the user with multiple pages or pop-ups. 

2. The essential fields will be arranged in a top-down linear format for easy navigation: Full Name, Email, Password. 

3. Password field will include a visibility toggle for user convenience and an inline password strength meter for added security.

4. An optional section will be located under the essential fields. This will contain Phone Number and Date of Birth fields. This section will be collapsed by default with a clear option (like "Add more info") to expand it. This way, optional fields won't clutter the initial view, but users can easily find and fill them if they wish.

5. Each field will have a clear and concise placeholder or label. 

6. An "Agree to Terms and Conditions" checkbox will be placed just before the 'Submit' button. The 'Submit' button will remain disabled until the checkbox is ticked to ensure users cannot proceed without agreeing to the terms.

7. Error messages (for example, for invalid email format) will be displayed in real-time beside the relevant field to help users correct mistakes quickly.

8. The 'Submit' button will be big and prominent, located at the bottom. Once clicked, a loading indicator will appear on the button to give feedback that the action is processing.

9. After successful registration, users will be redirected to a "Registration Successful" page with a welcoming message and instructions for next steps. 

10. The overall design will stick to the brand's color scheme and typography to maintain consistency. 

This intuitive and easy-to-follow design will make the registration process smooth and efficient for users.

## API Specification

Based on the UI/UX design for the user registration, here's the API specifications:

1. Endpoint: /api/users/register

2. HTTP Method: POST

3. Request Headers:
    - Content-Type: application/json

4. Request Body:
    - fullName: string, required
    - email: string, required, format: email
    - password: string, required, min length: 8
    - phoneNumber: string, optional
    - dob: string, optional, format: date (YYYY-MM-DD)
    - termsAndConditionsAccepted: boolean, required

5. Successful Response:
   - HTTP Status: 201 Created
   - Response Body: 
        - message: "Registration Successful"
        - user: 
            - id: string
            - fullName: string
            - email: string
            - phoneNumber: string, optional
            - dob: string, optional

6. Error Response:
    - HTTP Status: 400 Bad Request
    - Response Body: 
        - message: string explaining the error (e.g., "Invalid email format")

7. Real-time validation can be achieved on the client side using Javascript but if necessary, individual validation endpoints can be created for each field (email, password strength etc.).

The API should also include necessary security measures such as password hashing and data validation to prevent SQL injection and other security threats.

## Backend Architecture

To implement a backend architecture for user registration, the following elements need to be addressed:

1. **Database Structure**: 

    - User Table: This table will contain the following fields:
        - id: unique identifier for each user.
        - fullName: user's full name.
        - email: user's email address. This will be unique for every user.
        - password: user's hashed password.
        - phoneNumber: user's phone number.
        - dob: user's date of birth.
        - termsAndConditionsAccepted: a boolean indicating whether the user has accepted the terms and conditions.

2. **API**:

    - Endpoint: /api/users/register
    - Method: POST
    - Request Headers: Content-Type: application/json
    - Request Body: fullName, email, password, phoneNumber, dob, termsAndConditionsAccepted
    - Response: Depending on whether the registration was successful or not, an appropriate HTTP status code and a response message will be returned.

3. **Password Hashing**: Even though bcrypt encryption isn't available, we can use alternative hashing algorithms such as SHA-256 in combination with a unique salt for each user. The salt and hashed password will then be stored in the database.

4. **Data Validation**: To prevent SQL injection and other security threats, all input data will be validated and sanitized before being processed. This includes checking for required fields, verifying the format of the email address and date of birth, and ensuring the password is of the required length.

5. **Error Handling**: Appropriate error messages will be returned in the event of a bad request. For example, if the email format is incorrect, a message of "Invalid email format" will be returned.

6. **Rate Limiting**: To prevent brute force attacks, rate limiting can be implemented on the registration endpoint. This will limit the number of registration attempts from a single IP address within a certain time frame.

This is a high-level overview of the backend architecture. The actual implementation may vary depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the project.
