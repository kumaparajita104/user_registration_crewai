#### 2. Request Format

**Request URL:** `/api/register`  
**Method:** POST  
**Headers:**
  - Content-Type: application/json
  
**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "email": "example@domain.com",
  "password": "StrongPassword1",
  "confirmPassword": "StrongPassword1",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "phoneNumber": "1234567890", // Optional
  "profilePicture": "base64EncodedImageString", // Optional
  "termsAccepted": true
}
```

**Field Descriptions:**
- `email`: (string) User's email address. Must be in a valid email format and unique in the system.
- `password`: (string) User's chosen password. Must meet the password requirements: at least 8 characters, includes uppercase and lowercase letters, and at least one number.
- `confirmPassword`: (string) Confirmation of the provided password. Must match the `password` field.
- `firstName`: (string) User's first name. Required.
- `lastName`: (string) User's last name. Required.
- `phoneNumber`: (string, optional) User's phone number.
- `profilePicture`: (string, optional) Base64 encoded string representing the profile picture. Must not exceed 2MB in size.
- `termsAccepted`: (boolean) Indicates whether the user has accepted the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy. Must be true for registration to proceed.

#### 3. Response Format

**Response Codes:**
- **200 OK**: Registration successful.
- **400 Bad Request**: Validation error with specific messages returned.
- **409 Conflict**: Email already exists.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Unexpected server error.

**Successful Response Body:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Registration successful! Please check your email to verify your account."
}
```

**Validation Error Response Body:**

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "errors": {
    "email": "Please enter a valid email.",
    "password": "Must be at least 8 characters, include an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, and a number.",
    "confirmPassword": "Passwords do not match.",
    "firstName": "Please enter your full name.",
    "lastName": "Please enter your full name.",
    "termsAccepted": "You must accept the Terms and Conditions."
  }
}
```

**Conflict/Error Response Body:**

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Email already exists."
}
```

#### 4. Authentication Mechanism

- No authentication is required to access the registration endpoint, but it is highly recommended to implement a verification email step after successful registration.
- Upon successful registration, a verification email will be sent to the userâ€™s email address with a unique token link that the user must click to verify their account before they can log in.

#### 5. Security Considerations
- All data transmitted should be over HTTPS to ensure security in data transmission.
- Passwords should be stored securely using a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
- Rate limiting should be applied to the registration endpoint to prevent abuse (e.g., limiting to 5 attempts per minute).

### Conclusion

By adhering to this API contract, developers can create a robust, secure, and user-friendly registration system. The detailed specifications will ensure that all user data is validated correctly, errors are clearly communicated, and users receive the necessary feedback during the registration process, ultimately leading to a successful account creation experience.

## Backend Architecture

### Database Schema

To support user registration, we'll create a `users` table in MySQL to store user data. The schema will look as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    phone_number VARCHAR(15),
    profile_picture TEXT,
    terms_accepted BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    is_verified BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    verification_token VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### Field Descriptions
- `id`: Unique identifier for each user (Primary Key).
- `email`: Unique email address for user communication and login.
- `password`: Hashed password for user authentication.
- `first_name`: User's first name (required).
- `last_name`: User's last name (required).
- `phone_number`: User's phone number (optional).
- `profile_picture`: Optional field to store the base64 encoded profile picture.
- `terms_accepted`: Boolean flag to track whether the user accepted terms (required).
- `is_verified`: Boolean flag indicating if the user has verified their email.
- `verification_token`: A unique token for the email verification process.
- `created_at` and `updated_at`: Timestamps to track when the user account was created and last updated.

### Backend Service Details

#### 1. Framework and Technology Stack:
We'll use Node.js with Express as the web framework to build the RESTful API. For ORM, we can use Sequelize to interact with the MySQL database efficiently. 

#### 2. User Registration Logic:
- **Input Validation**: Using a library like `express-validator` to validate and sanitize input data based on the criteria specified.
- **Unique Email Check**: Query the `users` table to check if the email already exists.
- **Password Strength**: Ensure the password meets the specified criteria (length, uppercase, lowercase, number).
- **Hashing Password**: Use a hashing algorithm to store passwords securely (not bcrypt as per user constraint).
- **Storing User Data**: Save the validated user data in the database.
- **Verification Token Generation**: Create a secure, unique token the user will need to verify their email.

Example service function for registration:

```javascript
const registerUser = async (req, res) => {
    const { email, password, confirmPassword, firstName, lastName, phoneNumber, profilePicture, termsAccepted } = req.body;

    // Input validation
    if (!validateInput(email, password, confirmPassword, firstName, lastName, termsAccepted)) {
        return res.status(400).json({ success: false, errors: validationErrors });
    }

    const existingUser = await User.findOne({ where: { email } });
    if (existingUser) {
        return res.status(409).json({ success: false, message: "Email already exists." });
    }

    // Hash password (here, assumed as a simple series of transforms as we do not use bcrypt)
    const hashedPassword = simpleHashFunction(password); // Replace with actual simple hash function.

    const newUser = await User.create({
        email,
        password: hashedPassword,
        first_name: firstName,
        last_name: lastName,
        phone_number: phoneNumber,
        profile_picture: profilePicture,
        terms_accepted: termsAccepted,
        verification_token: generateVerificationToken(), // Function to generate a token
    });

    // Send verification email (function omitted for brevity)
    sendVerificationEmail(newUser.email, newUser.verification_token);

    return res.status(200).json({ success: true, message: "Registration successful! Please check your email to verify your account." });
};
```

### API Integration Strategies

- **Client-Side Integration**: The frontend will make a POST request to `/api/register` with the JSON payload containing user details. Proper error handling will be implemented to display validation messages based on the response codes.
  
- **Error Handling**: Ensure all responses are standardized as stated in the contract, and errors are clearly communicated back to the frontend.

- **Sending Verification Emails**: After successful registration, a verification email containing a token will be sent to the userâ€™s email address. The email would include a link routed to a new endpoint, e.g., `/api/verify/:token`, which will mark their account as verified.

### Security Considerations

1. **HTTPS**: All API requests should be made over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on the registration endpoint to mitigate abuse. This could be managed using middleware such as `express-rate-limit`.
3. **Input Sanitization**: Always sanitize inputs from users to prevent SQL injection and similar attacks.
4. **Password Policies**: Adhere to strict password policies during registration to enhance security.

By implementing the above structure, the user registration system will be robust, secure, and user-friendly, leading to a seamless account creation experience in accordance with the API specifications provided.
