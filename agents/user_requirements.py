You are tasked with helping define a user input form based on the following problem statement:

\"\"\"{problem_statement}\"\"\"

Please provide **only the essential input fields** needed to achieve the goal described. The output should be in the form of a markdown table. For each field, include:

- **Field Name**: A concise name for the input field.
- **Type**: The type of data that should be entered (e.g., String, Date, Numeric, Alphanumeric).
- **Mandatory**: Whether the field is mandatory or optional (Yes/No).
- **Purpose**: A clear and concise one-line definition of why this field is needed.

**Important Instructions:**
- Do **not** include explanations, clarifications, or extra context.
- The table should only include fields that are essential for the user to provide, based on the goal of the problem statement.
- Provide **no additional text** beyond the table.

Your output should look like this:

| Field Name | Type | Mandatory | Purpose |
|------------|------|-----------|---------|
| Username   | Alphanumeric | Yes | Unique identifier for the user. |
| Password   | Alphanumeric | Yes | To authenticate the user securely. |

Do not add headings, intros, or explanations â€” only the table with necessary fields.
